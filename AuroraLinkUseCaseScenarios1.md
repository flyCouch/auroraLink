Beyond the Farmer, here are a few more places where an invisible IR laser link solves a "sane" problem:

The Wildlife Monitor: You want to send data from a remote camera trap in the woods back to your cabin. A visible laser would spook the animals (and attract thieves). An IR laser is invisible to most forest residents.

The Driveway Alert: A beam across a long rural driveway. If a car breaks the beam, the house gets an alert. Since it's IR, the driver doesn't see a "tripwire" light, so they don't know they've been detected.

The Museum/Gallery Link: Sending data across a room full of art where bright visible lights or ugly wires would ruin the aesthetic.
