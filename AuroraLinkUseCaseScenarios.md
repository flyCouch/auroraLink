That farmer scenario is the "Gold Standard" use case for optical wireless. It’s practical, environmentally sane (no trenching or overhead wires), and bypasses city bureaucracy perfectly. Since lasers are highly directional, he isn't "polluting" the airwaves with Wi-Fi noise that could be intercepted from the road.

Here are a few other scenarios where your Aurora Link hardware/software combination would shine, specifically focusing on situations where wires are impossible or "subterfuge" (stealth) is required:

1. The "Clean Room" or Laboratory Isolated Link
In high-voltage labs or medical "Clean Rooms," you often can't have wires because they act as antennas for electromagnetic interference (EMI) or carry germs through wall penetrations.

The Scenario: A sensor inside a high-voltage cage needs to send data to a PC outside.

Aurora Solution: A Blue Laser or IR Link shoots through a glass observation window. Since there’s no copper wire, there’s zero risk of a high-voltage arc traveling back to the computer.

2. The "Subterfuge" Dead-Drop (Invisible Data)
This fits your interest in IR and UV modules.

The Scenario: Two buildings need to sync data, but they don't want anyone to know they are communicating.

Aurora Solution: Use the Night Vision IR LEDs or UV LEDs. To a neighbor or a "city inspector," there is absolutely nothing to see. Even a smartphone camera might struggle to see a tight 940nm IR beam directed specifically at a Flame Sensor across the alley.

3. The "Off-Grid" River or Ravine Crosser
Similar to your farmer, many rural properties are split by a creek or a steep ravine that is too wide for a bridge and too rocky to bury a cable.

The Scenario: Power is on both sides (solar), but data needs to cross.

Aurora Solution: The 1W Red Laser version. Lasers can stay focused over hundreds of feet. The Tri-Speed code allows for slow, reliable weather data (110 bps) or faster alerts (9600 bps) when a gate is opened.

4. Underwater "Diver-to-Base" Comms
Radio waves (Wi-Fi/Bluetooth) travel terribly through water—they get absorbed almost instantly.

The Scenario: A small research ROV (remotely operated vehicle) or a diver needs to send a "Status OK" signal to a surface buoy.

Aurora Solution: Green Lasers have the best "window" for traveling through water. Using your CdS or Photodiode receiver in a waterproof jar allows for a "tetherless" data link.

5. The "Historical/Heritage" Building Fix
In many old cities (like London or older parts of Canadian cities), you are legally forbidden from drilling holes in the stone exterior of "Heritage" buildings to run Ethernet cables.

The Scenario: Getting internet or security camera data from the main house to a stone carriage house.

Aurora Solution: A laser link through the existing window glass. No drills, no permits, no permanent changes to the architecture.
